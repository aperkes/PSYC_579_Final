\section{Introduction}

%% Visual search is a task in which the subject in an experiment is asked to
%% identify a target item amongst a sea of distractor items. Researchers designing
%% visual search experiments, such as ourselves, are usually interested in the time
%% it takes for the subject to find the target. It is not hard to imagine that
%% tasks end up falling into one of two categories: ``pop-out'' and ``serial
%% search''. In the first case, the target is readily apparent, and the response
%% time of the subject is independent of the number of distractors. In the latter
%% case, the target is better hidden, and the subject must examine each item in a
%% sequence. As a result, reaction time increases with the number of distractors,
%% and the increase per distractor is double per ``no'' responses than for ``yes''
%% responses.

%% In our experiment, we were primarily interested in the amount of time it takes
%% for a subject to identifying a cyclist through varying amounts of visual
%% ``clutter''. Furthermore, we were interested in seeing if and how different
%% colored tail lights on a cyclist would affect the time it takes for a subject
%% to identify them. 


An estimated $48,000$ cyclists were injured in motor vehicle traffic accidents in
2013, over half of which occurred in low light conditions \cite{nhtsa2015}.
Drivers often fail to observe cyclists, making cyclists particularly vulnerable
\cite{wood2013bicyclists}. Visual Search studies provide insight into why this
occurs.  Visibility is certainly an issue: bike lights are often quite dim in
comparison to car lights, and the intensity of the signal predictably
influences performance \cite{engel1977visual}. Attention also dramatically
alters perception. Since bikers represent rare events, drivers are not
attentive to their presence.  Additionally, visual search is influenced
dramatically by the azimuth \cite{treisman1980feature}. A bike in a bike lane
falls somewhere between $30^\circ-90^\circ$ lateral of the usual center of
vision of a driver.  Visual acuity drops dramatically as eccentricity
increases, making cyclists potentially invisible to drivers
\cite{wolfe1998there}. 

Here we seek to determine how color affects biker recognition in a
pseudo-realistic context. Because of the variety of factors involved, we
developed an experimental procedure to test visual search for bikers against a
backdrop of natural scenes filled with common distractors: cars, billboards,
street lamps, and stop lights.
